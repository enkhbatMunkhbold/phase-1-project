# Phase-1-Project

**Toyota Dealership** app is a company app, where the company publishes its used cars' list. The company can add or delete cars into or from the list. Users can select a specific car and see the details of that car.


## Goal

This app is built to demonstrate the skills I have gotten from the Phase-1 in the Flatiron School, using CSS, HTML, and JS files, which work together to complete and achieve the goal of the app.


## Work Environment

The app works locally, using url address 'http://localhost:3000/cars,' which means it is hosted in node server and on port 3000.


## Search List

One can search for car scrolling up and down the images in the list, on the left side of the screen. As he/she moves the mouse in the list, the background color of the car card in the list changes, indicating where the mouse is. If he/she clicks on a particular car image, the choose car's details will show up on the center of the screen.


## Delete Car

If one wants to delete a car from the list, he/she need to select the car in the list by moving the mouse. When the background color of the choosen car, double click on it. It will triggers the delete process from the list on the left of screen and from the backend as well. 


## Add Own Car

One can add a car to the list. To do this, he/she needs insert all info about the car by filling the form on the right side of the screen. When he/she completes inserting the all data, needs to push the **ADD** button on the bottom of the form.


## Demo

Here is an example of how the app works.
